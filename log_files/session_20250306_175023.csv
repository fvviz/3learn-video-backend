ATTENTIVENESS_RATING: 2

EYE_CONTACT_SCORE: 2
- The student's gaze is not directed towards the camera, suggesting they are not looking at the screen.

POSTURE_SCORE: 3
- The student is positioned at a very strange angle in the photo, making it difficult to determine if they are sitting or standing. The position also doesn't appear conducive to learning.

FOCUS_DURATION: 10%

DETAILED_OBSERVATIONS:
- The student is in a place that does not seem to be conducive to focusing, as a person is taking the selfie.
- The student's attention is not directed towards the screen.
- The student is likely distracted and not engaged with the online class.",2.0,3.0,6
2025-03-06T17:51:19.321004,3.0,"Okay, I will analyze the student's attentiveness based on the provided images.

1. ATTENTIVENESS_RATING (1-10): 3

2. EYE_CONTACT_SCORE (1-10): 4
- The student appears to be looking slightly upwards, but it's difficult to determine if it's directly at the screen. The angle is awkward.

3. POSTURE_SCORE (1-10): 2
- The posture seems quite bad. The student's head is tilted and the camera angle suggests that the student is too close to the camera, making it difficult to assess full posture but what is seen appears off balance. The awkward framing may also indicate repositioning or movement that distracts from the class.

4. FOCUS_DURATION: Estimated at 30%

5. DETAILED_OBSERVATIONS:
- The angle of the camera is not ideal. It's partially blocked. It's hard to assess eye contact precisely.
- The student's expression appears neutral, which doesn't necessarily indicate active engagement.
- The proximity to the camera is problematic, limiting the view of the screen and body language. The lighting is too bright.
- The observed behaviors suggest possible disengagement or at least a struggle to maintain focused attention on the online class. The positioning is unusual.
